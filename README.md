# MPEIProject

Search repeated news (using **Bloom filter**) and similar news (using **MinHash**) from a news api.

## Course
This project was developed under the [Probability Methods for Informatics Engineering](https://www.ua.pt/en/uc/12182) course of [University of Aveiro](https://www.ua.pt/).

## Bloom Filter
A **Bloom filter** is a data structure designed to tell, memory-efficiently, whether an element is present in a set.

**Bloom filter** is a **probabilistic data structure**: it tells us that the element either **definitely is not** in the set or **may be** in the set. 

## MinHash
**MinHash** is a technique for quickly estimating how **similar** two sets are.

## Grade 
This project's grade was **15** out of 20.
